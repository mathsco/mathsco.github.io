<a name="topics"><b><font size="+1">Course overview</font></b>.&nbsp;
Our text is <b>Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications</b>, 7th Ed.
by Kenneth H. Rosen.  We will cover
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1: Sections 1-5
    (propositional logic; predicates; quantifiers) <li>
<li>Chapter 2: Sections 1-4
    (sets; functions; sequences and summation) <li>
<li>Chapter 3: Sections 1-3
 	(algorithms, their growth and complexity) </li>
<li>Chapter 4: Sections 1, 3-6
    (modular arithmetic; Euclidean algorithm; solving congruences;
	RSA encryption) </li>
<li>Chapter 5: Sections 1-3
 	(mathematical induction; strong and structural induction;
    recursive definitions) </li>
<li>Chapter 8: Sections 1-3
    (recurrence relations; solving linear relations;
    divide-and-conquer algorithms) </li>
</ul>


<p>
<a name="slos"><b><font size="+1">Student learning goals</font></b>.&nbsp;
Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:

<ul>
<li>Evaluate the truth value of statements in propositional and predicate
 logic and use them to create and evaluate logical arguments.</li>
<li>Apply induction to prove mathematical statements.</li>
<li>Express sequences implicitly using recurrence relations and solve them
 for explicit functional representations.</li>
<li>Use mathematical notation correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="expectations"><b><font size="+1">My expectations of students</font></b>.&nbsp;
As a student in this course, you are expected to
<ul>
<li><b>come to class</b> each day.  Be seated and ready to begin
  at class start time.</li>
<li><b>turn off and put away cell phones</b>.</li>
<li><b>use electronic devices only to enhance learning</b>.
  Ipods, smart phones, tablets, or laptops can be valuable for accessing the
  textbook or viewing an online homework problem, but undisciplined use
  is quite distracting to you and to your classmates.</li>
<li><b>come equipped for class</b>, bringing your textbook (at least
  have access to it), pencil and paper.</li>
<li><b>read assigned passages</b>, often (but perhaps not always) from the
  text, and preferably <i>before</i> the session in which the material is to
  be discussed.  Remind yourself that reading mathematics is not like reading
  a novel.  You should read endeavoring to understand every sentence in its
  given sequence.</li>
<li><b>submit your work by due dates/times</b>.  WebWork assignments have
  clearly-marked due times&#151;if ever WebWork indicates a different
  date than the one on the course calendar, contact me to alert
  me to that fact.  But know that the WebWork time is the one in effect;
  answers will not be accepted after it is reached.</li>
<li><b>participate fully in classroom activities</b>.</li>
<li><b>spend some of your discretionary time between class meetings on
  class material (no exceptions)</b>.  Binge studying following an extended
  gap of time of inactivity leads not only to ill-preparedness for a day's
  material, but also an inability to ask questions on recent course content
  you do not understand.  That you should take one day in seven away from all
  school activities is, nevertheless, highly sanctioned.</li>
<li><b>keep a log of your own scores and test grades</b>.
  If, at any time, you want to estimate your grade, calculate a
  <a href="./wtAverager.html">
  weighted average</a> using the scores/grades you've earned so far.</li>
<li><b>take ownership for discerning the relative importance of
  various concepts</b>.  This is part of what it means to become a good
  learner.  Your professor will indicate sections of material/chapters to
  be covered on tests, but not how to apportion study time between topics
  appearing in those sections.</li>
<li><b>check your (Calvin) email regularly</b>, at least once in the
  evening each day.</li>
<!--
<li><b>take exams at the scheduled times</b>, contacting me at the
  earliest possible time if extreme circumstances arise.  I do not
  give exams to individuals earlier than the scheduled date.  Cheap
  airfares, early departures for vacations and the like are not
  considered valid excuses for taking an exam late.</li>
<li><b>seek help over problems</b> you are having in the course.  Do not
  set your sights on being able to do homework, or to pass exams, only.
  Your goal and mine must be to facilitate your ability to speak and write
  intelligently about the topics we discuss and the questions surrounding
  them.  When you know you are falling short of this goal, be proactive.</li>

</ul>

<p>
<a name="grading"><b><font size="+1">Grade Calculations</font></b>.&nbsp;
Your grade will be determined as a weighted average with the
following weights
<center>
<table>
  <tr>
	<td align="left">Online hW (WebWork)</td>
	<td> &nbsp; &nbsp; </td>
	<td align="right">5%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td align="left">Written HW</td>
	<td> &nbsp; &nbsp; </td>
	<td align="right">11%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td align="left">Exams</td>
	<td></td>
	<td align="right">54%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td align="left">Final Exam</td>
	<td></td>
	<td align="right">30%</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
<a name="exams"><b><font size="+1">Exams</font></b>.&nbsp;
There will be 3 exams given during the term.  The dates are
Oct. 9,
Nov. 6,
and
Dec. 4.
It is expected that you take each exam in class on these dates.
<b>Exams may not be taken early</b>.  If extreme extenuating
circumstances arise, contact me as soon as possible, and we will
discuss options for taking the test apart from the rest of the class.
(Cheap airfares, early departures for vacations, and the like, are not
considered valid excuses.)
The final exam is cumulative, and will occur on the date/time
posted <a href="https://calvin.edu/offices-services/center-for-student-success/registration/exam-schedule/">here</a> for your section.
Be sure to arrange your schedule so as to be available.
No electronic devices (including calculators) are allowed for exams.
Your work on an exam is to be done entirely by you, in real-time without
unauthorized prior knowledge of exam content, and without the use of
unauthorized notes or collaboration (voluntary or involuntary).  Violations
of this policy (cheating!) will result in a score of zero on the exam in
the first instance, and a failing grade in the course for a repeat offender.


<p>
<a name="hw"><b><font size="+1">Homework</font></b>.&nbsp;
Formal homework assignments will include problems of two varieties,
ones delivered and answered online via WebWork, and ones, usually taken
from the textbook, which are to be written up.  Links to assignments are
found on the <a href=
"http://scofield.site/courses/m251/cal.html">
class calendar</a>.  You should monitor this calendar closely, as it
changes regularly, keep on top of these formal assignments, and do
your work on time.

<p>
Informally, your homework includes <b>all relevant exercises</b> in
sections treated from the textbook.  Seek to become as knowledgeable as
you can in these topics, and as your expertise grows you will feel
correspondingly less concerned over your letter grade.

<p>
<a name="professor"><b><font size="+1">Contacting me</font></b>. &nbsp;
My office is NH 281.  If you are having trouble in the course &#151;
if you do not understand something important or have some special
circumstance that impedes your performance &#151; see me about it
<i>right away</i>!  <b>Do not put things off.</b>  The hours
I am intentionally in my office for
meeting with students are posted on the <a href=
"http://scofield.site/courses/m172/F19/">class webpage</a>,
as they are subject to change during the semester.
If we cannot connect at one of these times, feel free to
talk with me about an appointed time to meet, or swing
by my office and see if I am available to help.

<p>
I may be reached by phone at x66856, but a better way
to reach me for a non-technical question is by email.
If you require my approval for something, do
<b>not</b> consider having left a message for me
as equivalent to having obtained that approval.

<p>
<a name="accommodations"><b><font size="+1">Accommodations</font></b>. &nbsp;
Reasonable academic accomodations will be made for individuals with
documented disabilities.  Any student who this concerns should notify
one of the coordinators for services for students with disabilities
in the Center for Student Success, Spoelhof College Center 360.
That student should also meet with me during the first two weeks of
the semester to discuss academic accomodations.

<p>
<a name="exceptions"><b><font size="+1">Exceptions</font></b>. &nbsp;
I reserve the right to make changes or exceptions to course policies &#151;
including those described in this document &#151; either for the entire
class or for specific individuals.  The ultimate goal in this course is
<b>learning</b>, and formal requirements should not unnecessarily stand in
the way of that.  Thus, if you think that any of the conditions of the
course are interfering with learning, please speak with me about this,
and we will see what can be done.
