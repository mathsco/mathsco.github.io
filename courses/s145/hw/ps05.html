Do it and write up a nice solution to be graded.

<td valign="top" > helper problem 
<p>
These are problems that you do not need to turn in,
but may be helpful with other problems. It may be
similar to another problem and have a solution in
the book, to it may be an easier problem of the same
general type, etc.
You might want to look these over as you come to them,
but if you are convinced that you could do the problem,
just move on to the next one.  The material from
these problems will be covered in other problems.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top" > [n]</td>
<td valign="top" > ungraded problem
<p> This might be extra practice (good review for tests)
or simply a problem that you should know how to do
but which you do not have to write up for grading.
You are responsible for the material in these problems,
and the material may or may not be covered in other
problems.  One good way to use these is to read through
them and ask yourself questions like the following:
would I know how to do this problem if asked (outline the steps mentally
without doing them) What difficulties could arise?
How is this problem similar to or different from
the graded problems near it?
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top" > {n} </td>
<td valign="top" > optional problem
<p>
This is truly optional.  It may be an interesting problem,
but you are not responsible for anything you would learn
from that problem that is not already covered in other 
problems.
