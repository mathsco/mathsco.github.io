<td align="left" valign="top"> Read this section.  Think carefully about the distinction between  <i>population</i> and <i>sample</i>, the meaning of the term  <b>bias</b>, and how to recognize potential sources of bias.  The ideal sample would be a <b>simple random sample</b> (or SRS). Why is such a sample naturally unbiased?  And, if it is desirable to have an SRS, why do studies so often use samples which are not simple random samples?

<td align="left" valign="top"> Read the section titled &#147;When Am I Going to Use This?&#148;, up to (but you are not required to include) the part subtitled  &#147;Mathematics Is the Extension of Common Sense by Other  Means.&#148;  Then visit <a href=  "https://b.socrative.com/login/student/">Socrative</a>, select  Room <b>SCOFIELD188</b>, and answer the questions titled  &#147;Ellenberg: Intro.&#148;  Do this as an individual, not a  group exercise.  Do them in one sitting (i.e., no multiple  submissions).  These questions will be available only up  until the start of class on Thursday, so that is the deadline.
