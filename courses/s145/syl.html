<a name="topics"><b><font size="+1">Course overview</font></b>.&nbsp;
Welcome to this introductory course in biostatistics, which fulfills
a corequisite for Biology 224/225.
Statistics is a relatively young field (100 years or so old), one
that grew out of roots in the mathematical study of probability
and chance events, but has ends more like that of the scientist who
wishes to draw conclusions about the world from data, knowing that
error and imprecision are inevitable.  One might define statistics as
&#147;the science and art of obtaining, analyzing and interpreting
data for the purpose of reaching conclusions&#148; (Urquhart, 1971).

<p>
The specific topics we will cover include
<ul>
<li> types of statistical studies and sampling (Chapter 1)</li>
<li> exploratory data analysis (Chapter 2)</li>
<li> statistical inference using bootstrapping/randomization
  distributions (Chapters 3-4)</li>
<li> the normal distribution model (Chapter 5)</li>
<li> inference for population proportions and means using the
  normal model (Chapter 6)</li>
<li> chi-square tests (Chapter 7)</li>
<li> 1-way ANOVA tests (Chapter 8)</li>
<li> inference for regression (Chapter 9)</li>
</ul>
As time allows, we may also investigate multiple regression and/or
2-way ANOVA.

<p>
Despite its relative youth, the field has assumed an important role
in society today.  Politicians use polls to tailor their messages, and
short-term social studies to decide long-term policy.  New drugs are
approved for use only after experiments indicate some benefit with
essentially no life-threatening risk.  Business decisions are
increasingly data-driven.  To make an argument in public discourse,
one must be able to provide data and an appropriate analysis that
support one's conclusions..

<p>
As Christians, if we take seriously the Reformed idea of working
to help redeem Creation, becoming literate in the language and methods
of statistics takes on increased importance.
At a minimum, this can help us to discern between good and poor
statistical argument, insulating us from being swayed by the latter,
while helping us not to cast aside the former too readily when the
argument is counter to our own opinions.
For careers in the biological sciences or medical
field, this course is a first step to understanding conclusions in
the scientific literature based on statistical studies, a body of literature
to which you may add your own contributions one day.
-->
<!--
And, if you learn the methods
well, you will improve your ability to discover relationships between
variables on your own, and perhaps even help affect changes that
make society better for all.
-->


<p>
<a name="slos"><b><font size="+1">Student learning objectives</font></b>.&nbsp;
<!--
<ul>
<li>To understand many of the fundamental ideas of statistics, including
  (but not limited to) <i>variability</i>, <i>association</i>,
  <i>causation</i>, <i>distribution</i>, <i>significance</i>, and
  <i>confidence</i>.</li>
<li>To learn to apply and interpret the results of a variety of statistical
  techniques.  These include both descriptive and inferential methods.</li>
<li>To learn to analyze and critique statistical arguments,
  like those found in the media and in scholarly publications.</li>
<li>To learn how to use the software package <b>RStudio</b> to explore
  and analyze data.</li>
<li>To learn to communicate effectively one's
  knowledge of statistical ideas.</li>
</ul>
-->

Students completing this course will be able to
<ul>
<li>explain the basic concepts of experimental design and their role
 in answering biological questions.  
<li>choose appropriate graphical and numerical techniques to summarize
 univariate data and to describe the relationship between two variables.
<li>choose an appropriate statistical model to analyze data from
 several different standard experimental designs.
<li>construct and interpret confidence intervals and hypothesis
 tests for parameters of several statistical models.
<li>use a standard statistical software package (R) to carry out data analysis.
<li>state the underlying assumptions of the particular statistical models
 used in the course and explain the role that such assumptions play
 in these models generally.
<li>read journal articles that rely on statistical methods, to explain
 these methods, and to evaluate the appropriateness of the use of those methods.
</ul>
Student achievement of the first six of these outcomes will be assessed
via homework (to a lesser extent) and test questions (the greater portion).


<p>
<a name="expectations"><b><font size="+1">My expectations of students</font></b>.&nbsp;
As a student in this course, you are expected to
<ul>
<li><b>come to class</b> each day.  Be seated and ready to begin
  at class start time.</li>
<li><b>turn off and put away cell phones</b>.</li>
<li><b>use electronic devices only to enhance learning</b>.
  Ipods, smart phones, tablets, or laptops can be valuable for accessing the
  textbook or viewing an online homework problem, but undisciplined use
  is quite distracting to you and to your classmates.</li>
<li><b>come equipped for class</b>, bringing your textbook (at least
  have access to it), pencil and paper.</li>
<li><b>read assigned passages</b>, often (but perhaps not always) from the
  text, and preferably <i>before</i> the session in which the material is to
  be discussed.  Remind yourself that reading mathematics is not like reading
  a novel.  You should read endeavoring to understand every sentence in its
  given sequence.</li>
<li><b>submit your work by due dates/times</b>.
  The dates when assignments come due are marked on the calendar. 
  WebWork assignments have
  clearly-marked due times&#151;if ever WebWork indicates a different
  date than the one on the course calendar, contact me to alert
  me to that fact.  But know that the WebWork time is the one in effect;
  answers will not be accepted after it is reached.
  &#147;Written&#148; work (i.e.,
  that submitted in hardcopy) should be submitted to me at the start of
  class on the due date, and students who meet this deadline should check
  their names on the submission list brought to class that day; I will
  assume responsibility for those (and only those!) submissions.  If yours
  is not among those received in class, you may place yours in the appropriate
  folder outside my office by 5 pm on the due date, without it being
  considered late.  If it arrives by 5 pm the following day, it will still
  be graded, but (likely) at 50% reduction.  After that, it (likely) will
  not be graded at all.</li>
<li><b>submit only your own work</b>.
  You are encouraged, generally speaking, to consult with other students in
  order to better understand problems and their solutions.  When it comes to
  the answers you submit, the final product must be your own, not a
  transcription of someone else's responses.  The consequences of plagiarizing
  work will be a zero on the assignment/test of the first instance,
  and will become markedly more severe if another instance occurs.</li>
<li><b>participate fully in classroom activities</b>.</li>
<li><b>spend some of your discretionary time between class meetings on
  class material (without exception)</b>.  Binge studying following an extended
  gap of time of inactivity leads not only to ill-preparedness for a day's
  material, but also an inability to ask questions on recent course content
  you do not understand.  That you should take one day in seven away from all
  school activities is, nevertheless, highly sanctioned.</li>
<li><b>keep a log of your own scores and test grades</b>.
  If, at any time, you want to estimate your grade, calculate a
  <a href="./wtAverager.html">
  weighted average</a> using the scores/grades you've earned so far.</li>
<li><b>take ownership for discerning the relative importance of
  various concepts</b>.  This is part of what it means to become a good
  learner.  Your professor will indicate sections of material/chapters to
  be covered on tests, but not how to apportion study time between topics
  appearing in those sections.</li>
<li><b>check your (Calvin) email regularly</b>, at least once in the
  evening each day.</li>
<!--
<li><b>take exams at the scheduled times</b>, contacting me at the
  earliest possible time if extreme circumstances arise.  I do not
  give exams to individuals earlier than the scheduled date.  Cheap
  airfares, early departures for vacations and the like are not
  considered valid excuses for taking an exam late.</li>
<li><b>seek help over problems</b> you are having in the course.  Do not
  set your sights on being able to do homework, or to pass exams, only.
  Your goal and mine must be to facilitate your ability to speak and write
  intelligently about the topics we discuss and the questions surrounding
  them.  When you know you are falling short of this goal, be proactive.</li>
-->
</ul>

<p>
<a name="grading"><b><font size="+1">Grade Calculations</font></b>.&nbsp;
The weights placed on different measures of your course performance
will be as follows:
<ul>
<li>Homework (graded for correctness): 15%</li>
<li>Tests (and quizzes, if applicable): 57%</li>
<li>Final Exam (cumulative): 28%</li>
</ul>
I compute grades once at the end of the semester, not intermittently.
Apply your efforts to learning the material, and your grade will
correlate with these efforts.  If you must have a rough estimate of
your grade (all that is possible until the semester is complete),
keep good record of your homework scores and test grades, and calculate
a <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Weighted-Average">
weighted average</a> using the relative weights indicated above.

<p>
<a name="exams"><b><font size="+1">Exams</font></b>.&nbsp;
There will be 3 exams given during the term.  The dates are
Mar. 3,
Apr. 7,
and
May 12.
It is expected that you take each exam in class on these dates.
<b>Exams may not be taken early</b>.  If extreme extenuating
circumstances arise, contact me as soon as possible, and we will
discuss options for taking the test apart from the rest of the class.
(Cheap airfares, early departures for vacations, and the like, are not
considered valid excuses.)
The final exam is cumulative, and will occur on the date/time
posted <a href="https://calvin.edu/offices-services/center-for-student-success/registration/exam-schedule/">here</a> for your section.
Be sure to arrange your schedule so as to be available.
Your work on an in-class exam is to be done entirely by you, in real-time
without unauthorized prior knowledge of exam content, and without the use of
unauthorized notes or collaboration (voluntary or involuntary).  Violations
of this policy (cheating!) will result in a score of zero on the exam in
the first instance, and a failing grade in the course for a repeat offender.


<p>
<a name="hw"><b><font size="+1">Homework</font></b>.&nbsp;
Formal homework assignments will include problems of two varieties,
ones delivered and answered online via WebWork, and ones, usually taken
from the textbook, which are to be written up.  Links to assignments are
found on the <a href=
"http://scofield.site/courses/m251/cal.html">
class calendar</a>.  You should monitor this calendar closely, as it
changes regularly, keep on top of these formal assignments, and do
your work on time.

<p>
Informally, your homework includes <b>all relevant exercises</b> in
sections treated from the textbook.  Seek to become as knowledgeable as
you can in these topics, and as your expertise grows you will feel
correspondingly less concerned over your letter grade.
In the language of statistics, assigned exercises make up a sample,
taken at a specific moment in time, of your overall knowledge at that
time.  Your actual knowledge may be more or less than the sampled score
shows due to many factors, but the greater your overall knowledge, the
more consistently high these sampled scores will be.  Always strive
to maintain your handle on what you have previously known and, simultaneously,
increase that knowledge with new perspectives and new concepts.  Read through
unassigned problems from the book, working ones that appear to offer a new
challenge.

<p>
<a name="professor"><b><font size="+1">Contacting me</font></b>. &nbsp;
My office is NH 281.  If you are having trouble in the course &#151;
if you do not understand something important or have some special
circumstance that impedes your performance &#151; see me about it
<i>right away</i>!  <b>Do not put things off.</b>  The hours
I am intentionally in my office for
meeting with students are posted on the <a href=
"http://scofield.site/courses/s145/">class webpage</a>,
as they are subject to change during the semester.
If we cannot connect at one of these times, feel free to
talk with me about an appointed time to meet, or swing
by my office and see if I am available to help.

<p>
I may be reached by phone at x66856, but a better way
to reach me for a non-technical question is by email.
If you require my approval for something, do
<b>not</b> consider having left a message for me
as equivalent to having obtained that approval.

<p>
<a name="accommodations"><b><font size="+1">Accommodations</font></b>. &nbsp;
Reasonable academic accomodations will be made for individuals with
documented disabilities.  Any student who this concerns should notify
one of the coordinators for services for students with disabilities
in the Center for Student Success, Spoelhof College Center 360.
That student should also meet with me during the first two weeks of
the semester to discuss academic accomodations.

<p>
<a name="exceptions"><b><font size="+1">Exceptions</font></b>. &nbsp;
I reserve the right to make changes or exceptions to course policies &#151;
including those described in this document &#151; either for the entire
class or for specific individuals.  The ultimate goal in this course is
<b>learning</b>, and formal requirements should not unnecessarily stand in
the way of that.  Thus, if you think that any of the conditions of the
course are interfering with learning, please speak with me about this,
and we will see what can be done.
