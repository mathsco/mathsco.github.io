Question 18:
  There are infinitely many vectors to choose from.  But they are all
  from null(A), which has basis vector <-1, 2, 1>.  So, it comes down
  to choose x1 and x2 so they are both nonzero, both rescaled versions
  of <-1, 2, 1>, but not the same rescaling for both.

Question 19:
  This statement is True.  For T to be one-to-one (injective), all
  8 columns of A would need to be pivot columns, impossible since
  there are only 5 rows in which pivot positions can appear.  Said
  another way, rank(A) cannot exceed min(5, 8) = 5, which means A
  has at least 3 free columns, and hence a nontrivial nullspace.

Question 20:
  f is nonlinear, since
    f(pi/2) = 1, but f(pi) = 0.
  (If f were linear, then f(pi) should equal 2 f(pi/2) = 2.)

  As a map into the reals (-inf, inf), f is not surjective, since
  2 is not in the range of f.  Neither is f injective, since
  f(0) = f(pi) = 0.

Question 21:
  It suffices to find a 2-by-3 matrix A which has rank = 1.
  Take A = [1 1 1; 0 0 0], and define T(x) = Ax.
