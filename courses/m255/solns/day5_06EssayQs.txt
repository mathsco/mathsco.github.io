Question 23:
  It suffices to find a 3-by-2 matrix A which has rank = 2.
  Take A = [1 0; 0 1; 0 0], and define T(x) = Ax.

Question 24:
  This is True.  We can use the identity map, taking each input
  x to itself, as evidence.

Question 25:
  This is False, as one of the things which is true of isomorphic
  spaces is that they have the same dimension.  These two spaces
  do not.

Question 26:
  This is False, as one of the things which is true of isomorphic
  spaces is that they have the same dimension.  These two spaces
  do not.

Question 27:
  This one may be difficult to grade.  We as much said this is a
  fact in class.  If I attempt to prove it using the suggestions,
  I'd say:

  Since rank(A)=n, the columns of A are linearly independent.  Thus,
  the only linear combination of the columns of A yielding the zero
  vector is the one weighting each column by 0; that is, the null
  space of A (and the kernel of T) are trivial.  Now, if x_1 and x_2
  are vectors of R^n for which T(x_1) = T(x_2), then
     T(x_1 - x_2) = T(x_1) - T(x_2) = 0,
  which puts x_1 - x_2 in null(A), which only contains 0.  Thus,
    x_1 - x_2 = 0   ===>   x_1 = x_2.
  Summarizing, when T(x_1) = T(x_2), we conclude x_1 = x_2, making
  T injective.

Question 28:
  The coordinate function is an isomorphism between R^3 and R^3.
  The image of v, a vector coordinatized according to the standard
  basis, under the function C_B is [v]_B, and so the inverse of
  this map takes [v]_B back to its coordinatization relative to the
  standard basis.  The inverse to the transformation C_B is a
  transformation that has inv(A) as its coordinate function.  So,
  given [w]_B,  we have  w = inv(A) [w]_B.
