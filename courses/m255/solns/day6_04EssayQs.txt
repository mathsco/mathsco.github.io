Q18:
  Everyone should realize that for a triangular matrix, the eigenvals
  are the diagonal entries: 4, 7, and 5.  That dictates, up to
  choice of sequencing, the entries of the diagonal matrix.  The
  columns of the matrix P are not unique, but must be eigenvecs of A.

Q19:
  This is false.  Though a square, but not diagonalizable, matrix
  has to have a repeated eigenvalue, it is possible to have a repeated
  eigenval and still be diagonalizable.  Example 7.19 on p. 365 of the
  textbook provides an example.

Q20:
  The answer is "yes", every diagonal matrix is diagonalizable.  We
  simply take P and P^{-1} both to be the identity matrix.

Q21:
  This is true.  If P and D are the matrices, with D diagonal, for
  which  D = P^{-1} AP, then D^k is diagonal as well, and
  D^k = P^{-1} A^k P.
