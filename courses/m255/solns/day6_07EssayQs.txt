Q8:
  This is true.  For A, being orthogonally diagonalizable, there exists
  an orthogonal matrix P for which
   D = P^T A P    ==>    A = P D P^T
  Now, taking transposes of both sides,
   A^T = (P D P^T)^T = (P^T)^T D^T P^T = PDP^T = A.

Q9:
  This is true.  The key is that A^T A is both
   - square: when A is m-by-n, then A^T is n-by-m, and A^T A is n-by-n.
   - symmetric: (A^T A)^T = A^T (A^T)^T = A^T A.
  I am making the assumption that the original matrix A has real entries.
