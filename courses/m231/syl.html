<a name="topics"><b><font size="+1">Course overview</font></b>.&nbsp;
Welcome to a first course in differential equations.  Many physical
phenomena of interest in science and engineering are modeled using
such equations.  By solving these models, we can make predictions
concerning these phenomena.

<p>
Our main text is &#147;Ordinary Differential Equations and Linear Algebra:
A Systems Approach,&#148; by Todd Kapitula.  The focus of this book is
on linear differential equations: scalar equations of <i>n</i><sup>th</sup>
order, and 1<sup>st</sup> order systems.  We will cover most sections
in Chapters 1-5, perhaps omitting case studies and Section 3.6.  Though the
separable ODEs of Section 6.1 are often nonlinear, we will also discuss
how to solve them.

<p>
<a name="slos"><b><font size="+1">Student learning goals</font></b>.&nbsp;
 In this course we learn the fundamentals of linear algebra and of solving
 linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  Students will be able to
<ul>
<li>use terms of linear algebra such as <i>linear independence</i>,
  <i>span</i>, <i>basis</i>, <i>column space</i>, <i>dimension</i>,
  <i>subspace</i>, etc. accurately in their own writing, and understand
  them correctly when reading assignments and exercises use these terms.
<li>apply Gaussian elimination in diverse settings, such
  as finding null and column spaces of matrices, finding eigenvectors,
  inverting a matrix, etc.
<li>articulate the relationship between solutions of
  nonhomogeneous linear problems and their homogeneous counterparts, and
  apply appropriate techniques (factoring the characteristic polynomial,
  variation of parameters, undetermined coefficients) for finding the
  homogeneous and particular parts of solutions.
<li>solve scalar differential equations and initial value
  problems using analytical techniques such separating variables,
  and the Laplace transform.
<li>solve homogeneous systems of ODEs using eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
<li>derive rudimentary DE models based on physical
  descriptions of first-order problems.
</ul>
 Lectures, class activities, homework exercises, and readings from the
 text will all be used to develop these abilities in students.  Written
 homework exercises (ones submitted in hard copy for grading) and tests
 will be used to assess student achievement.

<p>
<a name="expectations"><b><font size="+1">My expectations of students</font></b>.&nbsp;
As a student in this course, you are expected to
<ul>
<li><b>come to class</b> each day.  Be seated and ready to begin
  at class start time.</li>
<li><b>turn off and put away cell phones</b>.</li>
<li><b>use electronic devices only to enhance learning</b>.
  Ipods, smart phones, tablets, or laptops can be valuable for accessing the
  textbook or viewing an online homework problem, but undisciplined use
  is quite distracting to you and to your classmates.</li>
<li><b>come equipped for class</b>, bringing your textbook (at least
  have access to it), pencil and paper.</li>
<li><b>read assigned passages</b>, often (but perhaps not always) from the
  text, and preferably <i>before</i> the session in which the material is to
  be discussed.  Remind yourself that reading mathematics is not like reading
  a novel.  You should read endeavoring to understand every sentence in its
  given sequence.</li>
<li><b>submit your work by due dates/times</b>.  WebWork assignments have
  clearly-marked due times&#151;if ever the WebWork system indicates a different
  date than the one on the course calendar, contact me to alert
  me to that fact.  But know that the WebWork time is the one in effect;
  Answers will not be accepted after it is reached.  Write-ups of answers to
  hand-checked problems should be submitted to me at the start of class on the
  due date.  Students submitting these write-ups at the appropriate time should
  also check their names on the submission list; I will assume responsibility
  for those (and only those!) submissions.  If yours is not among those
  received, you might place yours in the appropriate folder outside my office
  in hopes it will be graded, but that is by no means guaranteed.</li>
<li><b>submit only your own work</b>.
  You are encouraged, generally speaking, to consult with other students in
  order to better understand problems and their solutions.  When it comes to
  the answers you submit, however, the final product must be your own, not a
  transcription of someone else's responses.  The consequences of plagiarizing
  work will be a zero on the assignment/test of the first instance, and will
  be a course grade of <b>F</b> if another instance occurs.</li>
<li><b>participate fully in classroom activities</b>.</li>
<li><b>spend some of your discretionary time between class meetings on
  class material (no exceptions)</b>.  Binge studying following an extended
  gap of time of inactivity leads not only to ill-preparedness for a day's
  material, but also an inability to ask questions on recent course content
  you do not understand.  That you should take one day in seven away from all
  school activities is, nevertheless, highly sanctioned.</li>
<li><b>keep a log of your own scores and test grades</b>.</li>
<li><b>take ownership for discerning the relative importance of
  various concepts</b>.  This is part of what it means to become a good
  learner.  Your professor will indicate sections of material/chapters to
  be covered on tests, but not how to apportion study time between topics
  appearing in those sections.</li>
<li><b>check your (Calvin) email regularly</b>, at least once in the
  evening each day.</li>
<li><b>take exams at the scheduled times</b>, contacting me at the
  earliest possible time if extreme circumstances arise.  I do not
  give exams to individuals earlier than the scheduled date.  Cheap
  airfares, early departures for vacations and the like are not
  considered valid excuses for taking an exam late.</li>
<!--
<li><b>seek help over problems</b> you are having in the course.  Do not
  set your sights on being able to do homework, or to pass exams, only.
  Your goal and mine must be to facilitate your ability to speak and write
  intelligently about the topics we discuss and the questions surrounding
  them.  When you know you are falling short of this goal, be proactive.</li>
-->
</ul>

<p>
<a name="grading"><b><font size="+1">Grade Calculations</font></b>.&nbsp;
There are various components to your grade.  Here is what they are,
along with their relative weights:
<ul>
<li>WebWork assignments (9%)</li>
<li>Hand-checked assignments (8%)</li>
<li>Exams (3 given during the semester, 19% each, no matter what the
  number of &#147;points possible&#148; seems to reflect)</li>
<li>Cumulative final exams (26%)</li>
</ul>
I give these weights so that you can use it at various points as you desire
to estimate your grade.  You may employ this <a href="./wtAverager.html">
weighted average</a> calculator to assist you in doing so.

<p>
<a name="hw"><b><font size="+1">Homework</font></b>.&nbsp;
Homework is assigned regularly in this course, with due dates displayed
on the course calendar.  Homework assignments come in two varieties:
<ul>
<li><b>WebWork assignments</b>: These are submitted electronically and graded
  electronically, as well.  For most problems, you may submit answers
  multiple times.  This pairing of &#147;immediate feedback&#148; and
  having unlimited &#147;do-overs&#148; should be used  <i>cautiously</i>,
  It is intended to encourage mastery.  But, occasionally, a person's
  answers devolve into a series of guesses rather than refinements on
  an initial answer.  If you find yourself in such a state, you should
  set for yourself a limit on submitting guesses.</li>
<li><b>Hand-checked assignments</b>: The problems will not be quite as
  numerous as those you do in WebWork nor, on average, will they be quite
  as routine, sometimes requiring you to synthesize multiple ideas to find
  a solution.  Each problem offers the opportunity for exercise in writing
  a mathematical &#147;argument&#148; coherently, from start to finish.  So,
  along with working out a valid solution path, you are expected to
  present it neatly and clearly, in hardcopy (paper form)&#151;I will not
  accept electronic versions.  Neatness means all of the obvious things,
  but two things I particularly highlight are that multiple pages should be
  stapled, and your paper should not have any fringes, as if recently torn
  from a binder.  While you are welcome to discuss these exercises with
  other students, <b>your write-up must be your own</b>.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="professor"><b><font size="+1">Contacting me</font></b>. &nbsp;
My office is NH 281.  If you are having trouble in the course &#151;
if you do not understand something important or have some special
circumstance that impedes your performance &#151; see me about it
<i>right away</i>!  <b>Do not put things off.</b>  The hours
I am intentionally in my office for
meeting with students are posted on the <a href=
"http://scofield.site/courses/m231/">class webpage</a>,
as they are subject to change during the semester.
If we cannot connect at one of these times, feel free to
talk with me about an appointed time to meet, or swing
by my office and see if I am available to help.

<p>
I may be reached by phone at x66856, but a better way
to reach me for a non-technical question is by email.
If you require my approval for something, do
<b>not</b> consider having left a message for me
as equivalent to having obtained that approval.

<p>
<a name="accommodations"><b><font size="+1">Accommodations</font></b>. &nbsp;
Reasonable academic accomodations will be made for individuals with
documented disabilities.  Any student who this concerns should notify
one of the coordinators for services for students with disabilities
in the Center for Student Success, Spoelhof College Center 360.
That student should also meet with me during the first two weeks of
the semester to discuss academic accomodations.

<p>
<a name="exceptions"><b><font size="+1">Exceptions</font></b>. &nbsp;
I reserve the right to make changes or exceptions to course policies &#151;
including those described in this document &#151; either for the entire
class or for specific individuals.  The ultimate goal in this course is
<b>learning</b>, and formal requirements should not unnecessarily stand in
the way of that.  Thus, if you think that any of the conditions of the
course are interfering with learning, please speak with me about this,
and we will see what can be done.
