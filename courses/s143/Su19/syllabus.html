<a name="topics"><b><font size="+1">Course overview</font></b>.&nbsp;
Statistics is 
&#147;the science and art of obtaining, analyzing and interpreting
data for the purpose of reaching conclusions&#148; (Urquhart, 1971).
In this course we will learn explore, at the elementary level, just
what this means.  Along the way, we will learn
<ul>
<li>to ask questions which can be addressed
by means of statistical studies,
<li>appropriate methods for acquiring, organizing and viewing
data to answer these questions,
<li>what it means to make inferences about the population
at large from sample information,
<li>the use of some methods for making inferences in various
univariate and bivariate settings
</ul>

<p>
Our text is &#147;Statistics: Unlocking the Power of Data&#148;,
also known as <b>Lock5</b> because its authors are 5 members of
the Lock family.  We will cover Units A-C (Chapters 1-6), and
parts of Units D (likely Chapters 7, 8, and 9).

<p>
<a name="slos"><b><font size="+1">Student learning goals</font></b>.&nbsp;
Students will be able to
<ul>
<li>identify situations appropriate to various kinds of studies
  (controlled randomized experiments, observational studies, or
  surveys), and describe features inherent to well-designed
  studies of these types.
<li>organize, display, and summarize categorical and quantitative data.
<li>construct confidence intervals and carry out hypothesis tests from
  samples drawn from a population, giving accurate interpretations of
  the results.
<li>understand the role of statistics in the pursuit of truth,
  and be able to identify misuses which, either accidentally or
  intentionally, can hide that truth.
<li>use technology, as appropriate, for the outcomes listed above.
</ul>

    Lectures, class activities, homework exercises, and readings from the
text will all be used to develop these abilities in students.  Written
homework exercises (ones submitted in hard copy for grading) and tests
will be used to assess student achievement.

<p>
<a name="expectations"><b><font size="+1">My expectations of students</font></b>.&nbsp;
As a student in this course, you are expected to
<ul>
<li><b>come to class</b> each day.  Be seated and ready to begin
  at class start time.</li>
<li><b>turn off and put away cell phones</b>.</li>
<li><b>use electronic devices only to enhance learning</b>.
  Ipods, smart phones, tablets, or laptops can be valuable for accessing the
  textbook or viewing an online homework problem, but undisciplined use
  is quite distracting.</li>
<li><b>come equipped for class</b>, bringing your textbook (at least
  have access to it), computing device (likely a laptop computer),
  pencil and paper.</li>
<li><b>read assigned passages</b>, often (but not always) from the text,
  and preferably <i> before</i> the session in which the material is to be
  discussed.  Continually remind yourself that reading statistics is not like
  reading a novel.  You should read to understand every sentence in its given
  sequence.</li>
<li><b>submit your work by due dates/times</b>.  WebWork assignments have
  clearly-marked due times&#151;if ever the WebWork system indicates a different
  date than the one on the course calendar, contact me to alert
  me to that fact.  But know that the WebWork time is the one in effect;
  Answers will not be accepted after it is reached.  Write-ups of answers to
  hand-checked problems should be submitted to me at the start of class on the
  due date; reasons for not doing so should be compelling.</li>
<li><b>submit only your own work</b>.
  You are encouraged, generally speaking, to consult with other students in
  order to better understand problems and their solutions.  When it comes to
  the answers you submit, however, the final product must be your own, not a
  transcription of someone else's responses.  The consequences of plagiarizing
  work will be a zero on the assignment/test of the first instance, and will
  become markedly more severe if another instance occurs.</li>
<li><b>participate fully in classroom activities</b>.</li>
<li><b>block out a significant chunk of your day for statistics.</b>
  In four weeks, you are learning material that is spread out over nearly
  four months during Fall and Spring semesters.  So, along with longer
  daily class sessions, expect daily homework sets which are on a par with
  a full semester load of courses.  I suggest that, if possible, you spend
  afternoons in our classroom working on assigned exercises in the company
  of classmates.</li>
<li><b>take ownership for discerning the relative importance of
  various concepts</b>.  This is part of what it means to become a good
  learner.  Your professor will indicate sections of material/chapters to
  be covered on tests, but generally not the specific things within those
  sections to study.</li>
<li><b>check your (Calvin) email regularly</b>, at least once in the
  evening each day.</li>
<li><b>take exams at the scheduled times</b>, contacting
  me at the earliest possible time if extreme circumstances arise.  Cheap
  airfares, early departures for vacations and the like are not
  considered valid excuses!</li>
<li><b>seek help over problems</b> you are having in the course.  Do not
  set your sights on being able to do homework only.  Your goal and mine
  should be that you are able to speak and write intelligently about the
  topics we discuss and the questions surrounding them.  When you know you
  are falling short of this goal, be proactive.</li>
</ul>
	
<p>
<a name="hw"><b><font size="+1">Homework</font></b>.&nbsp;
Homework is assigned regularly in this course, with due dates displayed
on the course calendar.  Homework assignments come in two varieties:
<ul>
<li><b>WebWork assignments</b>: These are submitted electronically and graded
  electronically, as well.  For most problems, you may submit answers
  multiple times.  This pairing of &#147;immediate feedback&#148; and
  having unlimited &#147;do-overs&#148; should be used  <i>cautiously</i>.
  It is intended to encourage mastery.  But, occasionally, a person's
  answers devolve into a series of guesses rather than refinements on
  an initial answer.  If you find yourself in such a state, you should
  set a limit for yourself on either time spent or number of guesses
  submitted.</li>
<li><b>Hand-checked assignments</b>: The problems will not be quite as
  numerous as those you do in WebWork nor, on average, will they be quite
  as routine, sometimes requiring you to synthesize multiple ideas to find
  a solution.  Each problem offers the opportunity for exercise in writing
  a &#147;report&#148, so to speak.  Along with working out a valid solution,
  you are expected to present the details neatly and clearly, in hardcopy
  (paper form)&#151;I will not accept electronic versions.  Neatness means
  all of the obvious things, but two things I particularly highlight are that
  multiple pages should be stapled, and your paper should not have any fringes,
  as if recently torn from a binder.  While you are welcome to discuss these
  exercises with other students, <b>your write-up must be your own</b>.
</ul>
	
<p>
<a name="grading"><b><font size="+1">Grade Calculations</font></b>.&nbsp;
<p>
Homework, counting for 20% of your grade, will be assigned and collected
daily.  You may submit these assignments to me in class on the due date, or
place them in the <i>MATH 143 New Homework</i> folder in the box outside
my office door at any time up until it is picked up by the grader, who
will not pick it up before 3 pm on the due date.  Homework submitted
after the set has been taken will be considered late and <b>not accepted</b>.
Homework will be graded for correctness, and returned to the <i>Graded
Homework</i> folder outside my office, where you may pick it up at your
leisure.

<p>
Tests (3 of them) will come at about 1-week intervals; consult the
<a href="../calendar">class calendar</a> for specific dates.  These
tests will last for roughly half a class period, not the full 3 hours
allotted to the day.  In addition, a final exam (in-class portion?)
will take place on June 19, the final day of this Summer term.  The
final will account for at least 26% of your overall grade, with the
remainder reflecting your test grades.
You are expected to <b>take tests on the days they are given</b>.
If extraordinary circumstances arise (health problems, for
example), speak to me beforehand.

<p>
<a name="integrity"></a><b><font size="+1">Academic integrity</font></b>.&nbsp;
Webwork assignments are tailored individually, but vary only in minor
details.  You are welcome to work with others as you solve Webwork
problems.  Share ideas with others when working hand-checked assignments,
too.  Encourage the use of statistics terms between classmates,
try to understand overarching principles that apply to numerous
problems, and when two different approaches seem to lead to the
correct answer, explore why that is the case.  Just be sure to make
all write-ups yourself, using your own words, not simply using a
reworded version of someone else's answer.

<p>If an instance of academic dishonesty arises, this will result, in
the first instance, in a score of zero for all parties involved.  Should
there be another instance, this will result in failure of the course.

<p>
<a name="professor"><b><font size="+1">Contacting me</font></b>. &nbsp;
My office is NH 281.  I have a regular office appointment to keep
for the approximate time period 1-2 pm each weekday, but am otherwise
generally available in my office after class up until about 3:30 pm.
Most evenings Monday-Thursday I keep track of my email inbox.
If you do not understand something important or have some special
circumstance that impedes your performance &#151; talk with me about it
<i>right away</i>!  <b>Do not put things off.</b>

<p>
I may be reached by phone at x66856, but a better way
to reach me for a non-technical question is by email.
If you require my approval for something, do
<b>not</b> consider having left a message for me
as equivalent to having obtained that approval.

<p>
<a name="accommodations"><b><font size="+1">Accommodations</font></b>. &nbsp;
Reasonable academic accomodations will be made for individuals with
documented disabilities.  Any student who this concerns should notify
one of the coordinators for services for students with disabilities
in the Center for Student Success, Spoelhof College Center 360.
That student should also meet with me during the first two days of
the term to discuss academic accomodations.

<p>
<a name="exceptions"><b><font size="+1">Exceptions</font></b>. &nbsp;
I reserve the right to make changes or exceptions to course policies &#151;
including those described in this document &#151; either for the entire
class or for specific individuals.  The ultimate goal in this course is
<b>learning</b>, and formal requirements should not unnecessarily stand in
the way of that.  Thus, if you think that any of the conditions of the
course are interfering with learning, please speak with me about this,
and we will see what can be done.
