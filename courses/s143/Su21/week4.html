<h4>Tasks for Week 4</h4>
<ol>
 <li>Work through the material of the
   <a href="https://rsconnect.calvin.edu:3939/content/82">Randomization
   for Hypothesis Testing</a>,
   watching video tutorials as they are linked into the content.
 <li>Read Chapter 4, and perhaps review Section 5.2, in the Lock textbook.
 <li>From the book, "How Not to Be Wrong", by Jordan Ellenberg, read
   Chapter 6.  Then visit <a href=
   "https://www.gradescope.com/">gradescope.com</a> and answer the reading
   questions you find there.  These should be answered by 11 pm on
   Thursday, June 10.
 <li>Do the assigned exercises from Chapters 4 and 5 of the Lock textbook.
   This assignment is due by Saturday, June 12, at 11 pm.  Note: Prior to
   Chapter 5, the Lock's use the 68-95-99.7% rule, particularly taking
   the critical value <i>z</i><sup>*</sup>=2, not 1.96, when determining
   the margin of error for 95% confidence (centered interval method).
   Since you know 1.96 is more accurate, you should use that number in
   your work instead of 2.  Nevertheless, this means that, for odd-numbered
   problems, yours may look slightly different than the ones printed in
   the back of the book.

   retake it, multiple times, until you feel you are displaying a
   proper understanding of material.  While the scores from self-tests
   are not used in determining your grade, taking this self-test is
   required to get some practice using the Respondus browser.
