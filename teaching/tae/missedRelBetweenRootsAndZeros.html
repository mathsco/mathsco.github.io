<h2>Misunderstood Relationship between Roots and Zeros (MRRZ<A NAME="373"></A>)</h2>

<P>
	Much of one's mathematical experience prior to the calculus is spent
	in solving equations.  There are the kind of equations, known as
	<EM>identities</EM>, where every number in the domain is a solution.
	The equation

	is such an identity.
	It is not this, but the other type of equation, known as a
	<EM>conditional equality</EM>, that one learns to solve, precisely
	because solutions, also known as <EM>roots</EM>, of conditional
	equalities are not everywhere to be found.  Often there are very
	few numbers, perhaps even none at all, which make a conditional
	equality true.
<P>
Another fact about conditional equalities is that comparatively few
	of them may be solved exactly.  Leaps in technology have made it
	commonplace for students, with the purchase of a handheld calculator,
	to have at their fingertips powerful graphing capability and numerical
	methods for finding approximate solutions to many, perhaps even
	most conditional equalities.  This does not mean that one should
	forego learning the algebraic techniques which lead to exact solutions,
	thinking that deftness in pushing the right pair of buttons is an
	appropriate substitute for the thinking processes such algebraic
	methods introduce.  Still, there is added value in the knowledge one
	gets by investigating graphical methods.  By these methods
	one comes to think of the solutions of, say,

	(-1) and 6, 12 and (-1/2), 55 and (-6/55) are three such pairs --
	one thing which we can say for certain is that neither of the numbers

In summary, the error occurs in finding the zeros of a function
	and taking to be the roots of the equation, when the two concepts do not
	coincide.  There is a simple way to make them coincide.  We simply
	make one side zero (using a valid algebraic step, of course).

<UL>
<LI>Solutions of an equation like <IMG

</LI>
<LI>If the two functions are combined into one function on one

			in place of the old problem a new one (but entirely equivalent)
			of finding the solutions that correspond to points of intersection
			between the new left-hand side (in this case <IMG
 WIDTH="98" HEIGHT="38" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img110.png"
 ALT="$x^2 + 5x + 6$">)
			and the new right-hand side (here zero).
</LI>
<LI>When our combining of terms has left one side of the equation
			zero (which, when considered as a function, has the <IMG
