<P>
	The properties of equality that were mentioned earlier are, by some
	students, implemented incorrectly even when the situation calls for
	their use.  For instance, when solving an equation
	like

	Notice that, in the expression <IMG

	dictates that the multiplication by 3 comes before the addition of
	7, and the ``undoings" of these processes -- the subtraction of 7 and
	the division by 3 -- were carried out in reverse order.  That is not
	to say that we could not have undone things in a different order, but
	students who do so often make the following error.  Dividing by
	3, they often neglect the fact that <EM>all</EM> terms on both sides
	are to be divided by 3.  In other words, after dividing by 3 they
	write

Worse still is when a student thinks he can solve in one step
	(that is, take care both of the multiplication by 3 and the addition
	of 7 via one operation).  Such a student may write something like
