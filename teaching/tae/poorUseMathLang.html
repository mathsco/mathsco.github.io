<h2>Poor Use of Mathematical Language (PUML<A NAME="429"></A>)</h2>

<P>
	A prerequisite skill to writing good mathematics is the ability
	to write well in one's native tongue.  People who cannot write
	a complete English sentence should take remediation in English
	composition before reading on.
<P>
What may surprise some students is that good writing using
	mathematical symbols (even in the write-up of homework problems)
	consists of using complete sentences, setting up one's ideas
	clearly and then following through on the details, much as
	one expects from a good English essay.  The language and symbols
	of mathematics are used just like regular English words and phrases
	to express ideas, albeit ideas which one would often struggle to
	use any other means of expressing.
<P>
Nobody studies mathematical writing as a subject.  Your mathematics
	professor(s) got to be good writers of mathematics, if good they be,
	by reading papers and books by other mathematicians,
	not by reading a treatise such as this one.  If a book on good
	mathematical writing <EM>does</EM> exist (and there are probably a
	number of such books), they will say much more than I say here.
	I will only describe the most common example of poor mathematical writing
	I see when grading students' work: Using Equals as a Conjunction
	(<B>UEC</B><A NAME="433"></A>).
<P>
The word ``equals" has a very specific meaning.  It requires two
	objects, and it asserts that these two objects are the same.  In
	mathematics, the two objects are usually quantities, like the
	mathematical expression <IMG
 WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img121.png"
 ALT="$(3x + 5)$">, or the number 7.  Even within
	this tight definition, mathematical equations, as I mentioned earlier,
	come in two varieties: <EM>identities</EM> and <EM>conditional equations</EM>.
	A conditional equation is one such as the equation
<BR>

	which is only for particular values of <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img40.png"
 ALT="$x$"> (in this case <EM>one</EM>
	particular value).  In algebra courses
	one often sees conditional equalities in homework problems accompanied
	by the instruction ``Solve the equation".  There are some quantities
	that are the same regardless of the value of the variable.  A familiar
	example is the identity

Consider the typical calculus problem of evaluating a limit like

In contrast, suppose we begin with a (conditional) equation like
