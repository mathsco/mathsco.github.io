<H1>Top Algebra Errors Made by Calculus Students</H1>

<h2>Preface</h2> 

<P>
In recent years, it has been observed that the average student
enrolled in an introductory calculus course at the college level
is not as adept as she once was in her prerequisite algebra/precalculus
skills.  Whether this comparison with the past is accurate or not,
it is certainly true that the average student makes many errors
of an algebraic (rather than a calculus) nature, and this serves only
to divert her focus from the subject at hand.

<P>
To address the issue of poor algebraic skills, many writers of calculus
texts now include a preliminary chapter for the review of precalculus
concepts.  While, in theory, such a review seems a good idea, in practice,
the benefits, at least in the opinion of some, are dubious.  In the ideal
setting such a review would get ample time (with some students
getting advised to take an entire precalculus course at the college level
before entering calculus); instead, it
is usually clear that the teacher is trying to spend the minimal time
necessary so as to arrive at the calculus as early in the semester as possible.

<P>
This document was written, both out of experiences that have led to my
abandoning an algebra review at the start of first semester calculus
sections I teach, and out of certain realities at my institution.  As to
the former, it is my experience that a two-week review of precalculus
is of little value.  One might think that the stronger students might be
bored for a couple of weeks while the struggling ones gratefully
soak in the understanding of precalculus that has previously eluded them.
In my experience, it works the other way around.  The strong students
-- the ones who would do relatively well with no review -- are the
most engaged, while the weaker ones are buoyed up by a false confidence
bred out of a sense of familiarity with the topics.  For such students
there are two rude awakenings to come at the end of the review: the score
on the exam testing their knowledge of precalculus, and the very
unfamiliar and difficult (to some more than others)
concepts of calculus, now thrown more quickly at them
because several weeks were given over to review.  It is a discouraging
way to begin a course, and many students never get their heads above
water again during the semester.  In addition to experiences such
as these, I have a certain sympathy for the point of view that
students who have enrolled in a calculus course should get just that,
not some hybrid course that is inappropriate both for those who have
strong algebra skills, and for those whose lack of algebraic facility
calls for a more extensive study of precalculus.

<P>
As to the realities at my institution, recent changes
have led to the addition, rather than elimination,
of certain topics which had not formerly been in the first year of
calculus.  Roughly speaking, two and a half semesters have been
compressed into two.  Many of our students in first-year calculus are
studying to be engineers, and these changes are the result of the
attempts on the part of the Mathematics Department to accomodate the
wishes of our Engineering Department, while maintaining a calculus
sequence that is coherent and mathematically sound.  As one might
expect, we have tried to make the total course content for both
semesters of calculus comparable to what
it was before the change; we have increased breadth at the expense of
depth.  Nevertheless, several weeks of review at the start of a course
seems a more remote possibility than before.

<P>
It is not my response to ignore the sometimes-incomplete backgrounds
of our students, but to deal with the issue differently than with
an initial precalculus review.  I usually take
a just-in-time approach, providing a short treatise on various
precalculus concepts at the moments they become relevant
in our discussion of calculus.  For instance, I usually treat the
subject of inverses about the time one discusses the chain rule,
inverse trigonometric functions, or logarithms and exponentials.
Still, the day-to-day algebraic errors which students make, such
as the assumption that all functions behave linearly, are not directly
addressed by a review of the most important precalculus concepts,
whether this review comes all-at-once at the beginning of the course,
or in short bursts interspersed among calculus topics.  It is for
these remaining pervasive errors that I have written this piece.

<P>
To be straight about it, its purpose is two-fold.
One purpose is as mentioned above, to provide a detailed discussion
of some of the most common algebraic errors.  The other is to reduce the
amount of writing a conscientious grader feels compelled to do.  I
achieve the latter by giving names and 3 or 4-letter acronyms to the
error types.  When one of these errors is seen, a grader need only
write the acronym, not a long discussion of the error.  The student who
receives the abbreviated 4-letter comment is not shortchanged in the
least.  She may turn to this document, look up the acronym, read
the accompanying discussion, and benefit from it just as much (more?)
as she would have from a detailed comment.

<P>
Of course, for this grading/commenting system to be successful,
students must have access to this document.  It currently is
available on the web at
<a href="http://www.calvin.edu/~scofield/courses/materials/tae/">
http://www.calvin.edu/~scofield/courses/materials/tae/</a>.

<P>
Perhaps the bigger hurdle is that teachers must take the time
to read and note which errors are addressed herein, along with
the acronym used for each.  It may take a nontrivial amount of
time on the part of the instructor to get accustomed to all of
these.  Still, I believe the time invested in the beginning should,
in the long run, reduce an instructor's grading time.

<P>
Please address comments on this document -- both those intended
to improve discussion of errors already addressed and those
indicating an error which you think should be addressed --
to the author.  Also, if you use this document, a vote of
confidence by way of a quick email would be appreciated.
