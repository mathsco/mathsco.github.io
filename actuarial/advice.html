<h1>Advice for Actuarial Students at Calvin College</h1>

<p>

<p>
<font size="+2"><b>Exams</b></font><br>

<ul class="disc">
<li>
 Do your best to pass at least two of them while still a student
 at Calvin.  When you enter the job market, you will be competing
 with students from other institutions who have taken more.  You
 do not need to have taken an equal number in order to make it an even
 playing field, as there is much in your Liberal Arts experience at
 Calvin which employers desire and which is underdeveloped in these
 competing job candidates.  But if you can make the most of the
 well-rounded educational experience at Calvin <i>and</i> pass 3 or
 more actuarial exams, that is all the better.
<li>The usual exams to take first are Exam FM (financial mathematics)
 and Exam P (probability).  There is no set order to the exams, so
 these can be taken in whatever sequence suits you.  In terms of academic
 prepration, there are courses you should take at Calvin, MATH 271 and
 STAT 343 to be specific, prior to attempting Exam P, and students
 typically cannot take STAT 343 until the Fall of sophomore year at
 the earliest, with Fall of junior year being more typical.
<li>Try to pass at least one exam early in your college experience.
 Given the courses needed prior to Exam P, this leaves Exam FM as one that
 could be taken as early as the summer after high school graduation, but
 more typically would be attempted in the summer prior to your sophomore
 year in college.  Preparation is needed, and there are not specific
 classes at Calvin devoted to the syllabus covered by Exam FM.  Get some
 study materials (starting with some of the links on the previous webpage),
 do a lot of practice problems, and then give it a try.  This is, after
 all, good preparation for the studying you will do during the first
 few years in the career.

<font size="+2"><b>Internships</b></font><br>

<ul class="disc">
<li>Here are reasons to want one:
 <ul class="circle">
 <li>It provides a first-hand look at the kind of work actuaries do.
  This can confirm or, in some cases, raise a red flag at, your
  plan to pursue the career.
 <li>It provides relevant work experience.
 <li>Actuarial interns get paid.
 <li>Many actuaries took their first job in companies where they interned.
  If you enjoy the time you spend at an office, and the people there
  enjoy you, you have an advantage over a job candidate unknown at that
  place of employment.
 </ul>
<li>Some companies have &#147;information day&#148; events, often in the
 Fall.  Block out a day and get to one or more of these if you are able.
<li>Coincident with the timing of the &#147;information day&#148; events,
 companies tend to accept applications for internships in the early Fall,
 September or October.  The number of positions still available for
 internships in the coming Summer is fairly small by December or January.
<li>There seems to be more competition, probably forcing companies to
 adopt &#147;weeding measures&#148; that shrink the number of candidates
 with whom they actually meet.  Being able to say you passed an actuarial
 exam as you apply is very helpful, perhaps even becoming a &#147;must
 have&#148; qualification.
