<h2>On Death and Overpopulation, Sept. 3, 2018</h2>
This is not an entry to read to be comforted as you grieve the loss
of a loved one.  If you are in the throes of grief, I am so very
sorry.  Please send me a note to pray for you.

<p>
Our grief is, I think, meant to move us somehow.  If you believe,
as I do, that God made us with our emotions and need for relationships,
then grief is a natural part of our makeup and must serve a purpose.
We weren't meant to avoid it, nor to cover it over.  Before my time,
as I am told, people encountered it often, and at every stage in life.
In 1911, the infant mortality rate (IMR) in the U.S. was 135 deaths per
1000 live births.  Even as recently as the period 1950-1955, the IMR
worldwide was 152.  There were, as well, numerous instances in which
a mother died in childbirth.  An <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_longevity/2013/09/death_in_childbirth_doctors_increased_maternal_mortality_in_the_20th_century.html">article
of Laura Helmuth</a> states that a century ago over 600 women died per
100,000 births in the U.S., but that this figure is now down to 15.  A
recent figure puts infant deaths in the U.S. at 582 for 100,000 births
(i.e., 5.8 per 100).  Naturally there are many factors, not the least of
which is better medical care, which have helped to make these mortality
rates drop precipitously over 100 years.  We can hope that these numbers
can be made lower still.  In fact, the tone in Helmuth's article reflects
our 21st Century impatience that it should have taken this long.

<p>
Of course, while having a death in one's own house, or in the house of
a neighbor, was once commonplace even just for the limited reasons already
stated, there were plenty of other fatal dangers.  Alongside the development
of drugs that put off disease and prolong life, we have seen safety become
a watchword in American life; the lawsuit, for all its ills, deserves credit
for decreasing accidental deaths.  There are other factors, of course, and
the benefits to human life are undeniable, as life expectancy in developed
regions of the world has risen, according to <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy#/media/File:Life_Expectancy_at_Birth_by_Region_1950-2050.png">Wikipedia</a>,
from about 67 years to about 82 years since the 1960s.

<p>
This is all &#147;good news&#148;, though there is still much that can be
done, most particularly in bringing underdeveloped nations in line with
these developments.  Nevermind that, again from <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population#/media/File:World_population_v3.svg">Wikipedia</a>,
the world population has risen during this same period of 50-60
years from under 3 billion to nearly 7.6 billion.  Naturally, this
means competition for resources, along with its byproducts (war, famine),
continue to haunt us.  But now, at these high population levels, we are
seeing the new phenomenon that resource ends are in view---i.e., an end to
the supply of oil, the falling off of agricultural production in future years
perhaps due to soil becoming unserviceable or to the decrease in numbers of
bees and other helpers, perhaps even a climate that becomes inhospitable to
human life.  Some projections say the population will continue its increase
unabated to as high as 15 billion, perhaps in 50 years or less, and one can
imagine the atrocities that could accompany that kind of growth.  The hope
of Christians, Christ himself, may come before then.  Meanwhile, research
in the scientific community continues, in the hopes that innovation can
make for a sustainable environment&#151;sustainable for all life, not just
the human population&#151;even if/when we reach that level.  A question,
however, that should nag even the most optimistic thinker remains: so we
create a sustainable environment for 15 billion people.  What then?  Will
governments legislate limits on procreation at that point?  Will we
naturally gravitate, as a species, toward a view of sex as a recreational
activity only, with dwindling interest in producing
children?  Will our population continue doubling every <i>N</i> years,
but innovation remain in step with it?  Will we become nomads in a
universe that presumably has another life-sustaining world within reach
every time we exhaust the resources on our then-current planet?

<p>
I see a day coming when our impatience may be focused anew on the very
developments that stave off death.  Hear me out.  I am quite aware of the
fact that, at a personal level, our natural urge is to applaud such
innovation.  I may be able to say, in the abstract, that curing cancer is
not our most pressing problem&#151;one, say, that demands more resources
than reversing global warming&#151;but as soon as I hear of a positive
biopsy, my reaction, like anyone's, is to see cancer research as the best of
human endeavors.  Nevertheless, if/when resources become scarce enough to
threaten the lives of well-connected, affluent people, there will be a
corresponding drop in philanthropic concern for the masses.

<p>
I recently read <i>Inferno</i>, one in the series of books by Dan Brown
featuring the character Robert Langdon.  (The novelty of Mr. Brown's
formulaic writing has worn on me to the point that I don't trust my
opinion on whether it is a better or worse book than any of its predecessors.)
The villain is an intelligent, rich fellow who is so convinced that what
humankind needs to survive is a major hit to the population that he develops
a highly contagious virus for this purpose.  In the screenplay for the film
version, this villain is depicted as unambiguously evil, a mass murderer who
designs his virus to kill half the world's population.  Those who have studied
the history of plagues and devastating influenza outbreaks say this sort of
thing is coming; perhaps if/when it arrives, it will be seen as a correction
that saves life on earth as we know it.  But if we reach a day when someone
not only has the capability to release such a killer virus, but is lauded
as a hero for doing so, we will have turned a real corner morally as a species
(the same kind of corner, I hasten to add, that many think we turned
when abortion-on-demand became legal).  In Brown's book, the nature of our
villain is more ambiguous in that the virus he designs to infect all humans
does not kill, but only renders impotent, half the world's population.
Granted, I think human cloning if farther along in gaining acceptance than
such an act as this one from the novel, but it doesn't seem outlandish to me
that it would be viewed by historians as acceptable, at least if it really
did reduce population levels significantly.

<p>
I say &#147;if&#148;, because any such virus would bring on impotence in
seeming random fashion.  Many of its victims would be people with the means to
go child-shopping.  And many non-victims would be economically motivated
to take on child-producing as a business opportunity.  The function of
gender-specific organs could become &#147;entertainment only&#148; for most,
and revenue-generation for rest, those most fertile among us.  Perhaps the
next &#147;innovation&#148; would be biofactories that grew children in fetal
tanks.  In short order, these factories would be tailoring genetic traits
to order.  It makes Aldous Huxley look all the more prophetic to ponder
such a future.

<p>
In the end, my conclusion is that innovation, which has generated fortunes
and been the bringer of our age, is not as friendly to life as we might
first think.  Once a life-sustaining innovation becomes available, it
brings responsibility on those authorized to use it, responsibility to
save lives; to not do so is, at best, negligence, and at worst, murder.
But is there a mandate to innovate?  Is there a growing mandate, one
that looms larger as the human population grows, to slow, or even halt,
life-sustaining innovation?  I have argued that population growth cannot be
checked by a single person (visionary? madman?), as in Mr. Brown's book.
If it is to happen at all, it will take consensus, the kind of broad agreement
that would rule out birthing factories as one of its first, but not only,
measures.  That sort of consensus would take time and many conversations.
It might require throwing aside our hubris that sees past generations as
fools in comparison to the wisdom we now possess&#151;perhaps even
acknowledging ourselves as the fools&#151;and beginning to immerse our
young in the circumspect wisdom of plain, ordinary people of past generations.
By the time the world is ready, it may, indeed, contain 15 billion people.
But in having these conversations, in instituting this sort of education,
we could position ourselves better to answer my nagging question posed
earlier, "what then?"
